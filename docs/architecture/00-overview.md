# dodb architecture overview

Phase 0 established contracts for a transactional document/KV database whose
logical key is `(tenant, (pk, sk))` and whose value is opaque bytes. Phase 1
adds a checked single-file B+Tree storage engine for one shard. Phase 2 adds
the redo-only WAL and crash recovery. Phase 3 adds optimistic same-shard
point-key transactions and WAL group commit.
Phase 5 adds formal checkpoints, WAL reclamation, local physical snapshots,
and validated restore. Phase 6 adds the bounded raw QUIC application protocol,
the transport-independent service boundary, the local tenant/shard service,
and the first-party Rust client.

The planned v1 deployment is one compute process with one file per shard. A
tenant may later span multiple shards, so `TenantId` and `ShardId` remain
separate types and routing stays outside the physical document key.

## Workspace

- `dodb-core`: strong identifiers, revision state, key codec, semantic error,
  transaction request, condition, mutation, result, and transaction-set
  types.
- `dodb-storage`: fixed-page/header and double-superblock codecs, the
  `DurableFile` contract and production adapter, and the Phase 1 B+Tree,
  allocator, overflow storage, cache, invariant checker, and async shard
  facade with the Phase 4 committed-read lane and single-writer coordinator.
- `dodb-testkit`: deterministic volatile/durable file simulation, named crash
  points, and the simple reference database/transaction oracle.
- `dodb-service`: storage-independent request/response values and the
  asynchronous `DodbService` boundary used by transports and test doubles.
- `dodb-protocol`: the versioned big-endian binary frame codec and stable
  application error mapping. It depends on `dodb-core` and `dodb-service`,
  but not on storage or QUIC.
- `dodb-client`: the async Rust client. It depends on `dodb-core`,
  `dodb-service`, `dodb-protocol`, Quinn, and Tokio, and owns one reusable
  QUIC connection per client.
- `dodb-server`: the Quinn transport, TLS configuration, bounded stream
  execution, metrics, and local `TenantId -> ShardId -> AsyncShard` service.
  It depends on `dodb-core`, `dodb-service`, `dodb-protocol`, and
  `dodb-storage`.

Phase 5 remains local to one physical shard. Phase 6 keeps the same local
durability boundary: network requests never expose pages, WAL records, LSN
frames, superblocks, checkpoints, or snapshots. There is no replication,
remote object storage, public PITR, distributed checkpoint, authentication,
tenant authorization, or distributed routing.

The Phase 1 engine is a mutable fixed-4KiB slotted-page B+Tree with inline
small values and overflow pages. Phase 2 adds a separate redo-only full-page
after-image WAL, NO-STEAL, NO-FORCE publication, committed dirty-page flushing,
and startup recovery. Phase 4 adds an atomically published committed read view
for ordinary reads while retaining one physical mutation writer per shard. The
single-file constructor remains for storage-format tests; production path
opening uses the paired data/WAL files.
