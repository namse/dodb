# Phase 2: Write-ahead log and crash recovery

## Delivered

- Explicit versioned `DWAL` framing with little-endian fields, header and
  payload CRC32C checksums, trailing frame lengths, and database identity.
- `INIT`, full-page `PAGE_IMAGE`, and explicit `COMMIT` records.
- Strict record-LSN and batch sequencing with deterministic short-write loops.
- WAL-first commit ordering for `BTreeStore::open_with_wal` and production
  `open_path`, with the WAL sync as the durability point.
- One commit LSN for every mutation batch; document revisions and tombstones
  use that committed LSN.
- NO-STEAL committed dirty-page publication and an explicit data-file flush
  path. WAL remains retained from database creation.
- Startup recovery, torn-final-frame truncation, committed-unit filtering,
  full-page redo, superblock redo, idempotence, and post-recovery invariant
  checking.
- Distinct durability and recovery error categories in addition to I/O,
  corruption, unsupported-format, and invariant errors.
- Operation-indexed and named deterministic fault hooks, simulated durable-disk
  crash tests, structural recovery tests, corruption tests, and a real abrupt
  subprocess restart test.

## Preserved Phase 1 semantics

`PreparedBatch` remains a private overlay and one batch is still all-or-nothing.
Individual request errors abort the entire preparation and do not publish
earlier requests. The async coordinator still collects up to 64 requests in
its existing bounded window and submits one storage batch, allowing those
requests to share one WAL sync where the batch contains mutations.

The single-file `BTreeStore::open` constructor remains as a format/testing
compatibility path without a separate WAL. Production path opening and the new
paired `open_with_wal` constructor use the Phase 2 protocol.

## Non-goals

Phase 2 does not add a user-facing multi-key transaction API, OCC, MVCC,
snapshots, checkpoints, WAL compaction, replication, networking, or a
background flush service. The WAL API already treats a full set of page images
as one commit unit so Phase 3 can use the same recovery format for a validated
multi-key transaction.

## Validation

The test suite covers successful writes after data-file rollback, faults in WAL
headers/payloads/trailers and sync, missing commit records, named commit-boundary
injection, structural B+Tree changes, overflow/free-page reuse, torn tails,
middle corruption, wrong identity, recoverable page corruption, unrecoverable
page corruption, randomized deterministic crash/reopen differential sequences,
and a SIGKILL child-process restart loop.

The checked-in benchmark was run with 2,000 rows. On the recorded run, direct
small-value PUTs measured approximately 4,902, 6,462, and 7,044 ops/s for
cache capacities 0, 16, and 256, respectively, with one WAL sync per
operation. An overflow-value PUT run measured approximately 2,721 ops/s at
cache capacity 256. The async coordinator measured approximately 448, 1,678,
5,355, and 25,715 PUT ops/s for 1, 4, 16, and 64 clients. It used 65 WAL
syncs for 64 batches, amortizing about 63 operations per sync at 64 clients.
The 64-client run measured about 107.6 us average WAL append time and 0.4 us
average WAL sync time in this local environment. Small-value single-request
PUT used approximately 17.2 MiB of WAL for 2,000 operations; the 64-client
run used approximately 1.7 MiB because requests shared prepared batches and
page images. These are local benchmark observations, not compatibility
thresholds.
