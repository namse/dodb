# dodb v1 Correctness Summary

## Scope

This summary records the correctness work on `formal/quint-correctness` for dodb v1. The checked baseline is the production tree at `b2ca5105e992a82b4ea0ff772ebc2cb8d14e35f5`, including the coordinator collector byte-bound fix described below.

Coverage includes transaction semantics, grouped transaction serialization, coordinator physical collection and logical segmentation, WAL durability and recovery, publication/read visibility, checkpoint/WAL reset, end-to-end contract composition, Rust/model correspondence, and deterministic persisted-prefix crash exploration.

Use [`CORRESPONDENCE.md`](CORRESPONDENCE.md) for the contract-to-code map and detailed concrete/model boundary.

## Formal model inventory

The eight Quint models are finite abstractions. TLC and Apalache check invariants only within their stated bounds. Bounds below come from the current `.qnt` models and `package.json` commands.

| Model | Contract | Finite bound / abstraction | TLC | Apalache | Rust correspondence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `transaction_semantics` | Atomic conditions and mutations, conflict behavior, missing revisions, condition-only success | Keys A/B; two finite values; fixed transaction catalog; at most two setup commits; max 20 steps | Pass, max 20 | Pass, max 20 | `formal_correspondence` randomized reference test and existing transaction/revision tests |
| `transaction_group` | Ordered staging against earlier accepted writes, per-request outcomes, atomic group publication | Keys A/B; four fixed request sequences, at most three requests each; finite values; max 20 steps | Pass, max 20 | Pass, max 20 | `formal_correspondence`; transaction-group tests in `phase1_btree` and storage |
| `coordinator_segments` | FIFO mutation segmentation and barriers observing preceding mutations | One fixed nine-operation stream; finite A/B versions and barrier observations; max 20 steps | Pass, max 20 | Pass, max 20 | Fixed split/grouped coordinator pipelines and barrier tests |
| `coordinator_collection` | FIFO conservation, pending handoff, request/byte limits, oversized first request | Five fixed requests with sizes 0, 3, 1, 1, 1; request limit 2, byte limit 2; max 20 steps | Pass, max 20 | Pass, max 20 | Coordinator collector unit tests, including zero-byte then oversized request |
| `wal_durability` | Complete logical COMMIT markers govern recovery; physical group may contain multiple logical commits | Two logical commits; five fixed frames; durable frame-prefix positions 0–5; max 25 steps | Pass, max 25 | Pass, max 25 | Every-byte WAL prefix DST and WAL fault/recovery tests |
| `publication_visibility` | Read view sees a whole publication; response and visibility ordering under named failures | Two logical commits; finite publication phases, response states, and failure kinds; max 25 steps | Pass, max 25 | Pass, max 25 | Atomic read-view, before/after publication, and after-WAL-sync correspondence tests |
| `checkpoint_reset` | Checkpoint recovery authority, WAL reset forms, and history/LSN floor | Old/latest data states; checkpoint LSN 0/5; four WAL forms; finite crash origins; max 30 steps | Pass, max 30 | Pass, max 30 | Checkpoint operation/image matrix and exhaustive reset INIT prefix DST |
| `end_to_end_pipeline` | Fixed request order composing grouping, segmentation, responses, read barrier, checkpoint, and recovery | Six fixed requests; maximum physical group size 4; finite revisions and crash states; max 40 steps | Pass, max 40 | Pass, max 40 | Fixed grouped/split pipelines, coordinator barriers, and randomized Rust correspondence |

Every model also has a Rust-backend `npm run formal:*:test` check and a Quint typecheck in the reusable gate. Passing these checks says nothing beyond the model definitions and bounds listed here.

## Concrete Rust evidence

The concrete results below are deterministic correspondence and crash-testing evidence against the current Rust tree.

### Transaction and coordinator corpus

- Fixed correspondence pipelines exercise split physical groups and grouped mutations.
- The randomized reference corpus uses eight deterministic seeds and reports 4,800 groups / 7,844 requests: 395 condition-only successes, 1,571 conflicts, and 1,957 invalid requests.
- The corpus includes crash/reopen and checkpoint/reopen cycles, plus missing revision and ABA checks.
- Coordinator tests cover a barrier following mutations in the same collected physical group, and committed read-view atomicity.
- Publication failures cover `before_publish`, `after_publish`, and `after_wal_sync`; the observed error response does not imply rollback.

### WAL persisted-prefix DST

`durability_dst::every_unsynced_wal_prefix_recovers_only_a_logical_commit_prefix` explores every byte length from the durable INIT through one complete unsynced physical group containing logical commits A and B:

- Baseline WAL: 104 bytes; complete unsynced WAL: 16,864 bytes; tested prefixes: 16,761.
- Recovery counts: 8,380 with no commits, 8,380 with A only, and 1 with A+B.
- No B-only recovery occurred. The first A prefix is 8,484 bytes; the first A+B prefix is 16,864 bytes.
- WAL scan and BTree recovery are both checked at every prefix. Torn final frames reopen safely; recovered revisions match the corresponding commit LSNs. `next_lsn` is monotonic, including complete uncommitted frames, and the initial history floor remains zero.
- Recovered stores are continued with writes at semantic transition prefixes and the complete prefix.

Sync-error cases return an error to the caller while allowing none, partial (A-only), or all (A+B) of the WAL image to persist. Both prefix persistence and `SyncPersistAllThenIo` are exercised. This confirms that an fsync error response alone does not determine the recovered logical outcome.

### Checkpoint and reset DST

- All 26 named checkpoint operation fault points are crossed with available durable/volatile data and WAL images. Duplicate images are deduplicated, yielding 38 candidate combinations in this run.
- Every candidate combination reopens with exact A/B values and revisions, passes invariants, and permits a new commit whose revision exceeds both earlier revisions.
- The matrix exercises volatile checkpoint metadata after the superblock write, both old durable and empty volatile WAL after an unsynced truncate, a volatile complete reset INIT before its fsync, and an error after reset at checkpoint completion.
- All 105 prefixes of the 104-byte reset INIT image reopen against the durable checkpointed data. The checkpointed values and LSN floor survive; a subsequent write advances beyond the previous last revision.

Data-file candidates in this DST are only the last synced durable image or the current complete volatile image. Whole-file byte-prefix truncation is applied to append-only WAL streams, not to data-file overwrites. Existing short-write and repair tests cover selected partial data-page writes separately.

## Guarantees and evidence boundary

Quint results are **model-checked invariants** over bounded abstract models. Rust results are **deterministic correspondence and crash-testing evidence** for the sampled requests, images, and named failure positions.

The Rust implementation itself has not been formally proven.

The tested contracts include:

- A successful mutation transaction is atomic at the logical level.
- A condition-only transaction consumes no logical commit.
- Missing revision history survives delete and prevents a stale ABA `RevisionEquals` from succeeding.
- Accepted transactions in one group observe the staged state of earlier accepted transactions.
- A conflict or invalid request does not poison later requests in the group.
- Barriers run after the preceding mutation segment.
- Ordinary lock-free reads do not observe a partial grouped publication.
- A success response occurs only after WAL durability and publication.
- An error response does not necessarily mean rollback; durable effects may still recover.
- A complete COMMIT marker defines logical WAL recovery.
- A physical WAL group is not itself a logical atomicity boundary; its logical commits recover as a prefix.
- Checkpoint makes data authoritative before reclaiming WAL history.
- WAL reset preserves the history and LSN floor.

## Concurrency DST decision

The current baseline has one ordered coordinator writer and a committed immutable read view. The existing formal/composition and concrete tests cover the publication boundary and sampled barrier order. Exhaustive scheduler DST is therefore not a blocking requirement for closing this baseline correctness phase; no new concurrency model or scheduler framework is included here.

If the architecture adds page-local multiwriter behavior, parallel mutation publication, pipelined WAL/fsync, or lock-free mutable structures, reopen concurrency verification and add an appropriate concurrency model/DST before relying on this baseline.

## Remaining gaps

This result does not cover:

- Arbitrary sector/block reordering inside the data file.
- Arbitrary partial overwrite persistence for data pages.
- Real filesystem, kernel, or controller power-loss semantics.
- Hardware torn-write guarantees.
- All thread scheduler interleavings.
- Every workload or page-layout history.
- Formal proof of the Rust implementation.
- Future B-link experiments or non-main algorithms unless they are revalidated against this gate.

## Change safety matrix

| Future change | Verification to rerun or revisit |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction condition or mutation semantics | `transaction_semantics`, `transaction_group`, Rust correspondence and workspace tests |
| Coordinator batching or segmentation | `coordinator_collection`, `coordinator_segments`, end-to-end model, coordinator correspondence tests |
| WAL encoding or fsync behavior | `wal_durability`, persisted-prefix DST, Rust correspondence; also `checkpoint_reset` if reset contract changes |
| Publication or read-view behavior | `publication_visibility`, atomic-view and publication-fault correspondence tests |
| Checkpoint or WAL reset | `checkpoint_reset`, checkpoint/reset DST, recovery tests |
| Multiwriter or pipelined mutation/WAL architecture | Entire existing suite plus a new concurrency model and scheduler DST |

## Reproducible gate

This repository currently has no `.github/workflows` directory. The script is a CI-independent gate for local development and can be called by the eventual canonical repository or monorepo CI.

```sh
scripts/verify-correctness.sh fast
scripts/verify-correctness.sh full
```

`fast` runs formatting, the Rust workspace, all eight Quint Rust-backend tests, and all eight typechecks. `full` runs fast plus explicit correspondence and durability DST tests, all eight TLC checks, all eight Apalache checks, and a final `git diff --check`.

Measured wall-clock runtime for this audit run was 89 seconds for `fast` and 935 seconds for `full` (including all eight TLC and eight Apalache checks).
